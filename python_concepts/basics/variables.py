# Before we talk about variables
# you can print stuff in python

# print a single item
print(1)

# print multiple items
    #separate multiple items with commas
print(1,2,3)

# Variables

# you can assign a value as a variable

x = 1


# the variable may be any of the types from before

x = 1.0 #question defined x twice?


y = 3.0


z = 'Hello'



# you may also assign one variable to another
b = x

print(b,x)


# you may also assign a list to a variable
a = [1,2,3]

# printing again:
#   find out what value is assigned to your variable
#   debugging, etc

# print a single item
print(x)

# print multiple items
    #separate multiple items with commas
print(x,y,z)
